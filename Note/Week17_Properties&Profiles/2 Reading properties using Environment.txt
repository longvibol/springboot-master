Gold: Want to access the vale from the properties 

1. Add Environment

    @Autowired
    Environment environment;

(import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;)

2. in the log 

log.error("defaultPageSize value with Environment is : "+environment.getProperty("eazyschool.pageSize"));
        log.error("successMsg value with Environment is : "+environment.getProperty("eazyschool.contact.successMsg"));
        log.error("Java Home environment variable using Environment is : "+environment.getProperty("JAVA_HOME"));


3. the same testing as we setup the Filed with @Value annotation
