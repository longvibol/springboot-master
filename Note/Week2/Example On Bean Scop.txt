1 . @RequestScope (refer to http request send)

In the class ContactService

@Slf4j
@Service
@RequestScope
@Data
public class ContactService {
	
	private int counter=0;
	
	public ContactService() {
		System.out.println("Contact Service Bean initialized");
	}
	
	public boolean saveMessageDetails(Contact contact) {
		boolean isSaved = true;
		//TODO need to persist  the data into the DB table 		
		log.info(contact.toString());
		return isSaved;
	}

}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Mean that when we put the @RequestScope: the bean in this class when it create object base on the Http request.

- every request from HTML : the counter will be reset to 0 

- the constructor will be initial to the first start 

==> System.out.println("Contact Service Bean initialized")

ចឹងមានន័យថា បើមាន user send update contact to the back 100 Request it will create 100 object or bean the same. 

======================================================================================================

2. @SessionScope (refer to user or one brower) 

It will creates only one time bean from the http request : 

- counter will increase 1 ; 2 ; 3
- But for the : System.out.println ("Contact Service Bean initialized") it create only one time because it create only one bean in the " class ContactService"

** To make this scenario happened : We can open another brower and send the contact page ** 

Then it will create another bean for the new user or the new brower :
- counter will start from one again 
- System.out.println("Contact Service Bean initialized") it will create again in the log. 

Testing :  

* Brower 1, Send two time:

- counter increase 1 ; 2 
- Bean create only 1 Time 

* Brower 2, Send two time:

- counter start from 1 then increate to 2 
- Bean create again for another brower 


======================================================================================================

3. @ApplicationScope ( most use : from different user, from differnt brower, from differ computer)

Bean only create on time but the counter will increase and it never reset. 

Until we restart the application.
