2. How to store the object in the session 

We think where we can keep the user in the session : in the DashboardController after they log in it will directly to DashBoardController 

So we want to fetch the person Who is login : we need to get help from Repository 


@Autowired
	PersonRepository personRepository;

by personRepository we want to get who is login by find the email 

- In the Authentication authentication 

we can use authentication to get the person by the email (because it is unit ) if we can buy name sometime 
the person have the same name 

-> so in order to get the email from the sesson we need who it is the provider that why we need to go to 
EazySchoolUsernamePwdAuthenticationProvider class to make it send the name 

3. Store the user in the HttpSession httpSession

HttpSession httpSession is the Interface in the serverlet library use this parameter we can store the information inside the Session => then when ever we want to can use this store session in the Dasdboard controller 

 ==> session.setAttribute("loggedInPerson", person); : store the person object in the name "loggedInPerson" attribute 


យើងបន្ទប់មកទៀតពេលដែលយើងចង់បាន information we can get it from attribute : loggedInPerson

3.3 how to get the information from the session 

Person person = (Person) session.getAttribute("loggedInPerson");
