1. We create properties in order to easy reduce code when we want to change something 
Example:

We can set the properties on the page size if we want to view 5 page or 10 page 

So we change only inside the properties. 

======================

Gold we want to connect the value from the Properties to the java code 

1. In the property we create 2 variable 

eazyschool.pageSize=10
eazyschool.contact.successMsg=Your message is submitted successfully.

We want Java code to hold these two value! 


2. Example in the DashboardController

We create field to bind the value from property to the DashboardController

    @Value("${eazyschool.pageSize}")
    private int defaultPageSize;

    @Value("${eazyschool.contact.successMsg}")

(import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;)

Explain: @Value is the bind annotation to the properties 

in the logging message : 


	log.error("defaultPageSize value with @Value annotation is : "+defaultPageSize);
        log.error("successMsg value with @Value annotation is : "+message);


How to test it: 

1. put the Break point these two line 
2. Run as debug mode 
3. try to log in 

==> then it will stop at this break point so we can see the message in the consoled
