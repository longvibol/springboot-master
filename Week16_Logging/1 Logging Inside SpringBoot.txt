ពេលដែលយើងយក App យើងទៅធ្វើការដាក់ in production if we don't have logging how we can solve the issue 

- When we are in development we can see from the IDE.

There are logging as below:

- Fatal (logback doesn't have)
- Error 
- Warn
- Info
- Debug : check what error 
- Trace : in detail 

Logback is the routing include in Spring Boot.

By default from Spring Boot it will log : Error, Warning and Info 

Example 

In the application.properties 

debug=true


when we anable the debug=true it will log the : Info, Warning, and debug 

trace : Info, Warning, and debug
