Spring JDBC : 

- In order to talk to Database in order to perform : Delete, update, select we need an frame work to talk to database to. 

=============================================

Key points of JDBC :

+ JDBC: java Database Connectivity is a specification from Core Java that provide a standard abstraction for java apps to communication with various database. 

+ To access database : JDBC API along with the database driver is capable of accessing database
+ JDBC is a base framework or standard for frameworks like Hibernate, Spring Data JPA, MayBatis etc. 

===============================================

Steps in JDBC to access DB :

1. Load Driver Class
2. Obtain a DB connection 
3. Obtain a statement using connection object 
4. Execute the query 
5. Process the result set 
6. Close the connection


=====================================================================================

Key term to remember in spring jdbc:

- Template : Predefine connection (it will prepare the setup for us then connect to database)-Operation 
- we use ?​(where is the place holder) for where connection : in is jdbcTemplate 
- NameedParameterJDBCTemplate : គេប្រើ ឈ្មោះជំនួស ? វីញ វាស្រួលកុំអោយឃើញ ? ច្រើនពេក​

Responsible for the Spring JDBC and Developer 

+ Developer :
- Define connection parameters : what we want to connection : MySQL, Oracle, Postgress etc. 
- Specify the SQL statement : CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete 
- Declare parameters and provide parameter value. 
- Do the work for each iteration
