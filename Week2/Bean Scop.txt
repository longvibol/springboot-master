There are three in the Web Scopes : 

1. Request Scope : 
- Sprint create a lot of instance of this bean in the app's memory for each HTTP request 
- In the class we avoid to put more business logic because in Spring request Scope it will consuming a lot of memory 
==> Can be considered for the scenarios where the data needs to be reset after new request or page refresh 
Ex: user name, password verify 

វាប្រើច្រើនសម្រាប់ HTTP request និងវាមាន live time so short => so it will have more Grabit in the memory 


2. Session Scope 
- Session scoped beans have longer life & they are less frequently garbage collected. 
- Avoid keeping too much information inside session data as it impacts performance. 
Never store sensitive information as well. 

EX: like credit card, bank account it mean the value 

- Can be considered for the scenarios where the same data needs to be accessed across multiple
pages like user information. 

យើងគិតទៅបើវាប្រើលើ 5 Min យើងអាចប្រើវាបាន ដោយសារតែ វាមិនចំបាច់រក្សា ក្នុង Memory ច្រើន

Ex: Brand Detail 

3. Application Scope 
- In the application scope, Spring creates a bean instance per web application runtime. 
- It is similar to single scope. 
+ Singleton scoped bean is singleton per ApplicationContext 
+ Application Scoped bean is singleton per ServeletContext 

Considered scenarios : 

1-We want to store Drop Down values.
2-Reference table values which won't change for all the users.
